# How to run Shido Validator guide and optimizations

## Guides

The guides are accesible from this repository as PDF files named as "How to ...".
Their writable sources are also available from this repository under "sources" folder.

## Optimizations

### Auto clean
In order to make your shido node to clean itself (meaning do removed previous and unused transactions and indexes from database), you have to:
Modifiy your `/path_to_your_shidod_folder/config/app.toml` as following:

```
#Prune type
pruning = "custom"

#Prune Strategy
pruning-keep-recent = "100"
pruning-keep-every = "0"
pruning-interval = "10"

```
Modifiy your `/path_to_your_shidod_folder/config/config.toml` as following:
``` indexer = "null" ```

> After all these modifications you have to restart your node, that may that up to 1h to run back properly.
> And your database can take more than 1h to refelect those modifications, depending on your database size.

### Peers

In order to make your shido node more effective regarding blocks synchronizations, you have to ensure that it relies on more than few peers.
So we need to find more seeds other than those provided by shido team.
We can do this easily with the following command on your node (please do not stop your node, open a new shell instead):

```
curl -s http://localhost:26657/net_info | jq -r '.result.peers[] | "\(.node_info.id)@\(.remote_ip):\(.node_info.listen_addr | (split(":")[2]) | select(. != null))" | select(. |  match("([0-9]{1,3}[\\.]){3}[0-9]{1,3}"))'

```

### Seeds

In order to make your shido node more effective regarding blocks synchronizations, you have to switch from "peers" to "seeds" by
modifying your `/path_to_your_shidod_folder/config/config.toml` file as following:

```
#from:

seeds = ""
persistent_peers = "7ed728831ff441d18a8556b64afcaebc31b68c74@3.76.57.158:26656[...]"

#to

seeds = "7ed728831ff441d18a8556b64afcaebc31b68c74@3.76.57.158:26656[...]"
persistent_peers = ""

```
> Here you should update the list with the one gathered from the "peers" command.
> Or copy latests seeds from here [Seeds](https://github.com/dub1t0/shido-validator/blob/main/seeds.txt)

> You have to restart your node to see the effects.

> **You have an already optimized ``config.toml`` file is this repository at [config.toml](https://github.com/dub1t0/shido-validator/blob/main/config.toml)**

### Logs

In order to make your shido node more effective regarding IOPS, you have change your logs settings by
modifying your `/path_to_your_shidod_folder/config/config.toml` file as following:

```

#from
log_level = info

#to
log_level = "warn"

#from
log_format = "plain"

#to
log_format = "json"

```
> Please notice that after these changes the output of a ``shidod start`` may produce a "black screen" as there will be "text" only if there are warnings.

> Please restart your node to make this effective

### Transactions

In order to make your shido node more effective regarding transactions, you have change your logs settings by
modifying your `/path_to_your_shidod_folder/config/config.toml` file as following:

```

#from
broadcast = true

#to (disable mempool broadcasting on validator -- less traffic is more cycles)
broadcast = false

#from
keep-invalid-txs-in-cache = false

#to (don't retry previously failed transactions)
keep-invalid-txs-in-cache = true

#from
max_num_inbound_s = 240

#to
max_num_inbound_s = 80

#from
max_num_outbound_s = 30

#to
max_num_outbound_s = 60

#from
timeout_commit = "3s"

#to
timeout_commit = "1s"

```
> Please restart your node to make this effective.

### Remaining
In order to make your shido node more effective regarding remaining , you have change your logs settings by modifying your /path_to_your_shidod_folder/config/config.toml file as following:
```
#from
flush_throttle_timeout = "100ms"

#to
flush_throttle_timeout = "10ms"

#from
peer_gossip_sleep_duration = "100ms"

#to
peer_gossip_sleep_duration = "10ms"
```

### System tunning

**INCREASE MAX OPENED FILES**
```
# Check the current limit
ulimit -n

#edit /etc/sysctl.conf
nano /etc/sysctl.conf
# Append
# Max opened files
fs.file-max = 65535

#edit /etc/security/limits.conf
nano /etc/security/limits.conf
# Append
# Max opened files
